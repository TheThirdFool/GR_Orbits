# GR_Orbits

This is a code that uses the Euler method combined with post newtonian corrections to simulate a two body system (more or less). This code works reasonably well but does struggle a little when it comes to the PN correction of order 2.5. I'm not sure what the problem is but I don't need to figure it out right now so it's extremely low on my priority list. Feel free to use or not use as much as you want. 

This was used in completion of a general relativity module at the University of Surrey (2020).
